PyData Manchester is a meetup for people using open source data tools. We’re into data science, data analysis, deep learning and visualisation. And despite the name,it’s not all about Python (we also like R, Julia, JavaScript and Fortran). If it’s open source and to do with data, we’re into it.

## Two events, every month

### Talks and Panel Discussions

We host talks where experts come and share their knowledge, or guide us through a hands-on exercise. Some months we run a panel discussion on a choosen theme.

### Code Night

Bring along your side-project, a problem you're working on, or perhaps a new library that you'd like to try out. Ask for advice if you need it, or help your neighbour if they get stuck.

## Who are we?

We're pleased to say that we're a diverse bunch, and come from a wide range of backgrounds. Diversity and inclusivity are very important to us, and we care about our code of conduct (please do give it a read).

Some of us are just getting into data. A few of us have PhDs. Many of us are self taught. **We're all still learning**.

Why not come and say hello on Twitter? You can also find us on the PyData UK Slack (there's a #manchester channel).
